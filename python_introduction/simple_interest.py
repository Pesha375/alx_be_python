# Defining the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate as a decimal
time = 3          # Time period in years

# Calculating the simple interest using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
interest = principal * rate * time

# Printing the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
